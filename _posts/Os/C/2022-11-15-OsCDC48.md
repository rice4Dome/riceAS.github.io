* **Key message**  
    + OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle
    + Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.
    + Our results indicated that the impaired function of OsCDC48 was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype
