* **Key message**  
    + By contrast, OsRMT1 is predominantly found in the nucleus and microtubules and its degradation is inhibited under salt stress
    + Overexpression of OsRMT1 in Arabidopsis resulted in increased tolerance to salt stress
    + Our findings suggest that the abundance of microtubule-associated OsRMT1 is strictly regulated, and OsRMT1 may play a relevant role in salt stress response by modulating levels of its target proteins
