* **Key message**  
    + Immunogold electron microscopy (EM) with specific OsRMR1 antibodies showed that OsRMR1 proteins were found in the Golgi apparatus, TGN, and a distinct organelle with characteristics of PVC in both rice culture cells and developing rice seeds, as well as the protein body type II (PBII) or PSV in developing rice seeds
