* **Key message**  
    + All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages
    + Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80 % reductions)
