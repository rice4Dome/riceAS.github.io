* **Key message**  
    + The results suggest that JMJ705 is a biotic stress-responsive H3K27me2/3 demethylase that may remove H3K27me3 from marked defense-related genes and increase their basal and induced expression during pathogen infection
    + Further analysis revealed that JMJ705 is involved in methyl jasmonate-induced dynamic removal of H3K27me3 and gene activation
    + Jumonji C domain protein JMJ705-mediated removal of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation is involved in defense-related gene activation in rice
